# Notification Improvements

Separates out pull requests, issues, & issue comments into "notifications" These show up as a badge next to your username in the userbox, and have their own section in the inbox

Today we rolled out updates to the messaging & notification systems for GitHub.  There's a few new features, and some tweaks to existing features.

### Notification Center

If you check the account settings page, you'll notice a new tab called Notification Center that holds preferences for all the emails you get from GitHub.

### Commit Comment Notifications

We've enabled two new email notifications by default: comments on your commits (where you are listed as an author or committer) and comments on commits in your repositories.  You can also turn off notifications for noisy commits.

### Improved email subjects

All of our email notifications were previously "[GitHub] user sent you a message" — they should be considerably more descriptive now, saying exactly what kind of email they are.

### Notifications vs Messages

We also separated out pull requests and issue notifications into a new category under your inbox.  Your inbox should now be filled solely with actual messages.  Notifications will show up next to your username (in grey), while the inbox count will reference messages.

Another small update is that we've added a *mark all as read* button to the inbox and notification sections.

We know there's always room for improvement with our messaging and notifications — but this should be a step in the right direction.
