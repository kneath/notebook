# New Repository Headers!

We just pushed out an updated header design for all repository pages, you can see it in action on any of our [project pages](http://github.com/rails/rails)

![Repository Header Comparison](http://share.kyleneath.com/captures/skitched-20091227-193611.jpg)

The new headers fixed some long outstanding bugs (downloading the wrong branch for example) and added a few new little features (exposing HTTP clone urls, noting which branch you're currently on)

Hope you like 'em!
