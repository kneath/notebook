# Geeking out with git for writing

* Always write articles on your own computer (blogging system agnostic)
  * But still be able to access & edit drafts from anywhere
* Git is pretty fantastic, isn't just about history
  * Writing log (automate merlin's word counter thing)
  * Branches for different directions, ADD problems (write 5 articles at once), think writing chapters, merging when finished
  * The index as a review tool
  * git add --patch keeps your writing log clean & focused
* Published all my drafts to GitHub (probably bad idea, we'll see what comes of it)
  * Free formatting
  * Free history viewing
