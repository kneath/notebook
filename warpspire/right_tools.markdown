# First rule of interaction design: use the right tool for the job

Interaction design can mean a lot of things in today's world.  At it's most basic: interaction design is the description of how people interface with other things.  The things I'm most often concerned with are pieces of software (be them web, mobile, or desktop).  I'm no expert in interaction design, but there's one simple rule that if learned, will help you learn 80% of the entire field overnight.  Seriously.

***Use the right tool for the job.*** No, seriously -- that's it.

Mastering this idea is very difficult.  It's easy to get side-tracked and lose sight of your goals during the design process, but at the heart of every great interaction design is the use of the right tool for the job.  That could mean changing colors on a link as you hover on it, or using a bar chart instead of line chart, or even the decision of whether to build your application as a desktop application or a web application.

## The best tools are silent

How do you know when you've found the right tool? When you *don't even notice it.*  That means that the result was exactly what you expected to happen -- and really, isn't that what ease-of-use means?  Let's try and illustrate that with some examples.

### Typing into a search field and pressing return searches the website

If you type into the search field on the sidebar of this site and press `return` on your keyboard, the form submits and search results are shown.  It's probably not something you even think about.  But you'd be amazed at the number of websites who force users to click the search button manually.

### Using the scroll wheel scrolls the page

If the page can scroll, using the scroll wheel should scroll the page.  Again, seems like complete common sense -- but there are *tons* of websites out there who don't support this. You can blame technologies all you want, but at the end of the day it's the way the creators implemented the technology that's at fault -- not the technology itself.

## Just think about what you're **doing**
