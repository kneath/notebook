# Personal Finances: The most important skill you don't have

Ever wish there was one skill you could learn that could make all your dreams come true?  Truth is there is... and it's frighteningly simple.  Learn to manage your personal finances, and you'll be able to do whatever you want in life.  Seriously.

Having a grip on your personal finances is a thing of beauty.  If you're a freelancer, it means sleeping in peace at night even though the checks are late. If you just lost your job, it means a bit of breathing room.  If you're comfortably employed, it means getting the things you want without guilt.

## Know how much you spend

The first step to getting ahold of your personal finances is knowing how much you spend on what.  Services like [Mint](http://mint.com) have helped this out tremendously.

But even if you're all hooked up to Mint, I'd strongly suggest making a simple spreadsheet by category.  With something super simple like the screenshot below you can play around with numbers and see what you can afford (like say, when you're moving).

You can see it's pretty vague. But it's *accurate*.  It's better to have a line item of $275 "WTF" money than to pretend you don't spend it each month.  You can spend time later figuring out *where* the money's going, but knowing how much you actually spend each month is *huge*.

## Know your taxes

It seems to me that people generally suck at knowing how much Taxes they will owe.  Taxes are fairly simple at a high-level, and knowing how they work at a high-level can help you tremendously. There's no reason that April 15 has to feel like you're betting on a horse -- you should know how much you owe / will get back all throughout the year.

Understand how the tax tiers work.  Just because the tax bracket ends at $79,000 and you make $79,001 next year doesn't mean anything, your taxes will be the same.  Understand how deductions work and how they differ from tax credits.  Deductions take money off your income as if you didn't make it, and tax credits are equivalent to cash in hand.

Understand that contracting work (freelance) is taxed much higher than work you get through a W-2 (standard employment).

Pay an accountant to explain all of this crap to you in detail; there's no reason you should be reading the tax code.  A couple of hours at the accountant *one year* can help you get a grip on your taxes for the rest of your life.

## Know your fees

Whether it's fees on your eTrade account where you've got a few shares of AAPL, or fees on your bank account, or fees on your credit card -- know what they mean.  Financial institutions make money off lying to their customers, and fees are generally how they get around those lies.  Even "no-fee" entities generally have fees somewhere in the line.

You'd be surprised how much people pay in fees.  The Average American has around $5,700 in credit card debt alone.  Multiply that by 20% interest and you get some nasty numbers.  Numbers that people shouldn't be paying anyway!

## Know what you want

The most important part of personal finances is knowing what you want.  There is no one plan that will make everyone happy.  You've got to know what you want first.

### Reduce Stress

Want to reduce stress? Start saving money in a high-interest savings account (NOT a CD or investment account) to account for 3-6 months of living expenses.  Say you lose your job, you'll have 6 months to find a new one before things get dire.  It's a huge stress reliever.

### Buy a house

Want to buy a house? Realize that it's going to cost you a ton of money.  And there's no reason your car might not explode the day your new house closes.  Don't listen to idiots rambling on about "throwing away money on rent" -- figure out if you can afford a house before you buy it.  Because the only thing that's worse than throwing money away on rent? Throwing money away on a bad house loan.

### Travel

Or maybe you just want to get the hell away from people.  Save up money and go tour Asia for a few years.  It's actually surprisingly cheap to go vagabonding around the world.  But make your decisions now.  Do you really need all this crap if you're going to leave?  Live minimally. Sell your car, cancel your cable bill, and get rid of your cell phone.  We Americans have a tendency to hold on to as much crap as possible... don't waste money buying this crap if you don't intend on using it.

## Stop listening to the idiot media

Last but probably most important: stop listening to anything the mainstream media says. They're all fucking morons.  They'll tell you to buy stocks, hire a broker -- you'll make millions.  They'll tell you that you're really spending money on cantelopes and chocolate.  They won't tell you that most brokers don't beat their baseline.
