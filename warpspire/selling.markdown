The real secret to surviving an economic turndown (learning from failure)

Reading the news today is pretty depressing.  If it's not the financial sector collapsing, it's a newspaper shutting down, or a tech company laying off half it's staff.  But I can't say I'm too surprised.  There's a lot of reasons for our failing economy, but I can't say our failing economy is the reason many of our companies are closing up shop.  It was definitely the catalyst that brought their problems to the surface -- but there's problems deep down that have been brewing for decades.

And the solution to all of these problems is pretty simple.  Sell products or services people will purchase for money.  I know, radical concept.  It actually comes back to the most basic economic principal in the world: Supply and Demand.

## Example 1: The Newspapers -- selling products people don't want to buy

Newspapers are failing all over the country.  Just the other day, the Seattle P-I closed down.  Some people think it's crazy: the P-I has been around since 1863! How can it possibly go belly up?  Well, it's pretty clear: they kept selling goods that were decreasing in demand.

## Example 2: The Studios -- refusing to sell products people want to buy

It's not too often that your customers tell you how they want to buy your products, then move on to build a distribution system that's open source and pushes the cost of distribution to the customers themselves.  Any other industry would cream their pants at this kind of opportunity. The studios? They figured it'd be best to put these people in jail.

Instead studios turn to crazy convoluted schemes where they make the 3rd episode of the 5th season available on Wednesdays, at least 9 days after the episode aired on (free!) broadcast TV -- but only available online via Hulu.  God forbid they operate more like a usenet, and *charge* customers to download episodes after they air on TV over premium bitorrent.

## Example 3: The US Car Manufacturers -- selling inferior products

Sometimes a competitor comes into the arena and just flat out makes a better product that costs less than your product.  This is a sign to innovate.  Create a superior product and win back your customers.  This is a pretty basic rule of free markets, and I'm not sure why the US manufacturers seem to be immune from it.

## Example 4: The New Web -- refusing to sell anything at all

Here's a business plan for you: I'd like to set up shop creating widgets -- pretty standard stuff -- except my twist is I'm going to give them away for free.  Seems dumb, doesn't it?  Well that's what 90% of online startups are doing right now.  It's mind-boggling idiotic. How in the hell investors are comfortable with this is beyond me.
