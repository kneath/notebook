# On the subject of Photosohp

If there's one piece of software I can legitimately say I cannot do my job without -- it's Adobe Photoshop.  I've been using Photoshop (seriously) since around version 6.5.  Sure, I had my run-ins with Paint Shop Pro, Painter, Photoshop 3.0, etc back when I was busy making chromed out text -- but it took until about version 6.5 when I *really* started using the software to do valuable work.

I can unequivocally say that Photoshop is a *great* piece of software.  It's benefits far outweigh it's detractors and there is no other piece of software that lets me create the designs I want.  I hope people realize how huge that is.  Can I create websites without Photoshop? Sure. But I can't create the ones I do without it. They would be different.

## On the subject of ditching Photoshop all together

There are many voices out there that say it's a good idea to skip Photoshop since we're building websites and not images.  I never understood that theory. It's throwing the baby out with the bathwater.  Sure, you can't get text to render just as it will in a browser, and you may not get the same spacing you have in your comps... but that's why they're comps.
