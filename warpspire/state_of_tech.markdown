The state of the startup culture surrounding online tech is depressing.  The past few years have birthed thousands of companies with huge financing, massive hype, enormous praise -- and hardly any new ideas or revenue streams.  CEOs claim success based on user signups, ignoring the huge red numbers on their profit & loss statements. Best practices are based upon how big your funding round was, not how viable the company is. And thus starts a never-ending cycle that leaves outsiders looking in on the Silicon Valley as one huge circle-jerk.  Can't say I blame them.

People call out companies like Twitter, Facebook, MySpace and digg as the most successful startups out there.  But where's their revenue? Why aren't any of them publicly traded?  Why are they still laying off people if they're so unanimously successful? The answer is simple: **we've defined popularity as the metric for success, not revenue.**

Why did we create a culture in which user numbers define a company's success? I'm not sure.

## Why focus on money?

It may seem overly greedy to focus on money as a metric for success -- but never forget, that's the whole point of a startup -- **to make money for the investors.** If you don't want to play the money game and just do it for the thrill, start a non-profit or a side-project.

If you want to create a startup, your goal should be to *start up* a company which is self-sufficient and makes a return on the investor's original investments.  This means bringing in revenue to cover your expenses, and hopefully a little more to put in that *profit* bucket.

## The idea is dead

Browsing recently funded startups and their pitches used to be pretty exciting to me in 2005.  Founders were spending lots of time thinking about ways to create real value with unique ideas.  But now it seems founders are just selling "It's like X for Y!" type ideas, or when all else fails -- wording their pitch to *sound* unique while offering a service that's already out there (and done better).

Here's some *actual* pitches from recently funded startups (names replaced with 'Company', otherwise unedited).  As an added perk, I'll be throwing their 3-month traffic as a percentage of my own side-project, [Poetry With Meaning](http://poetrywithmeaning) (fe: if they have 5x the traffic as PWM, it will read 500%).

> A Web-based software link with a Mobile-Based application work together for a better information sharing, using a standard cell phone (internet/GPRS/UMTS connection required) as a computer terminal.

**Traffic:** N/A  
What.

> Company is a provider of high-definition video conferencing over the Internet. It is a competitor to Webex which was bought by Cisco.

**Traffic:** 70%  
Sounds like you've got a real chance to compete with the world's #1 provider of network equipment who's been in business for 24 years and annual revenues over $39B.

> Company is building the web’s favourite community for those who share a passion for guitars.

**Traffic:** 0%  
If it's not done, how can it be the web's favorite? ($20 says this turns out to be a custom-coded forum & tab database)

> Company is an IT performance management provider that delivers the end-to-end service insight required for today’s cloud applications. By experiencing network performance without affecting it, the company’s patented path solutions assess network readiness, monitor service levels, and diagnose problems otherwise hidden from sight. Leading companies rely on Company to assure application delivery and expand their service portfolios with confidence.

**Traffic:** 70%  
I love to experience my network without affecting it (it's my favorite past-time).  Actually, no, this pitch is just 100% bullshit. It's agency-speak.

> We’ve devleoped a new language of communication spoken with images for today’s Visual Generation. Pictures reveal things about us that words can’t reach. By choosing pictures that you like, Company allows you to illuminate your personality, your changing moods and emotions, and discover affinities with people, lifestyles, destinations and things. Company will be covering all areas of life including: Home, Fashion, Travel, Health, Food & Drink, Entertainment, and Sport. Since March 2007, Company has matched over 4.5 million people worldwide with other people, products, and places that they have strong affinities with.

**Traffic:** 500%  
This actually sounds pretty cool until you visit the site. It turns out it's a run of the mill dating service that replaces word questionnaires with image questionnaires (i.e. you click a picture of some math equations instead of typing/selecting "Math").

All in all, these companies received about $41 million dollars in funding.  Most still have less traffic than my little side-project Poetry with meaning (which has been revenue-positive since launch coincidentally).

## There's still good ideas

The thing is, there's actually a ton of very successful online tech startups.  People like [Github](http://github.com), who never even *took* funding, and are paying themselves salaries from their revenues.  Or massively successful companies like [37Signals](http://37signals.com) who rely on people paying them for their products.  But in this circle-jerking startup culture, they're generally considered mostly irrelevant to mainstream success.

In my mind, they're more successful than a company like digg.  Github and 37Signals are able to pay their employees and not rely on VC money or loans to do so.  This is what startups should be all about -- creating a successful business.

## What makes a successful startup?

There is one thing I've been noticing about startups who move on to make money.  It's that they don't have straw-man "idea men" in front.  They have people who know what they're doing.  They have immensely talented developers, designers, marketers -- creative people.  The companies who are highly visible without revenue are backed by people that I'll call "networkers."  They believe the world is all about connections.  Which is true... but your connection has to mean something. Exchanging business cards isn't a connection.  A connection means you have some stake in the other person's life... do you share interests? Hobbies? Work?

## There is a precipice ahead 

I think in the next 3 years we're going to see a sobering reality.  When the big "successful" companies of today start to find they can't pay their workers with registration confirmations and see that Google isn't acquiring anyone -- they're going to have to massively scale back, sell-off, or close up shop completely.
