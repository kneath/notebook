# On producing more intelligent design

## The bullet points

I came up with this technique when I found myself increasingly being one of those people who "has ideas" but never executes on anything.  What I realized is that I did have ideas -- but I always jumped right into executing them rather than writing them down.

Now whenever I have an idea, I immediately grab a piece of paper and start writing down whatever is in my brain.  It helps me focus my thoughts and think about how to do make something valuable, and why I'm building it in the first place.

I used to do this with Moleskines, but it just didn't work for me -- I never work in chronological (or sensical) order. Now I'm back to my old faithful engineering paper.  I love it because it's structured, and I can tear it off and scatter it around.
