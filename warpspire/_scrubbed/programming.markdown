Programming is not easy

It is strange to me so many people call themselves programmers.  Programming is not an easy task.  It is one thing to produce code that performs a function. It is quite another to engineer a solution.  The latter is programming, while the former is nothing but coding.

It has taken me a long time to fully appreciate programming.  In the 7<sup>th</sup> grade, I first started dabbling with HTML and ASP (3.0).  It was then that I was introduced to programming, and only recently (11 years later) that I have really begun to understand the art.

Programming to some is sewing together strings of characters that *do something.*  This isn't programming, this is just writing code.  Writing code is only a small piece of programing (albeit an integral part).  Programming is many things, but coding is just one aspect.  Programming is *hard*.  It's *really hard.*  Your job is to make a machine perform a task that represents an idea in the mind of another human being.  This is very difficult.

## Programming is

Programming is understanding problems.  You must not only understand the small problems (*how do I multiply two numbers?*) -- but you must understand how the small problems must be linked together to create a coherent solution.

Programming is providing solutions, not excuses.  Coders can blame a technology, a platform, or project management -- but programmers must not.  Programming means that you are constantly thinking of ways to solve the problems at hand.  Excuses do not solve problems -- but solutions do.  Programmers must look beyond the ego and put the problem in first priority.

Programming is thinking beyond the code.  What could happen if the hard disk crashes?  What could happen if the password is leaked? Programmers are not paid to stop at a solution. You must look past it to provide enhancements and warn of potential risks.  Programmers must understand the solution and understand what portion of the problem it solves.  

Programming is translation.  You must translate the ideas of one or more human beings into a string of 1's and 0's that perform some function.  Programmers use critical thinking to tie this world to the virtual one.  They must constantly re-assess the solution and ensure that it sits in line with the idea.

## In conclusion

Programming is more an art than it is coding.  Understanding a language and the steps towards creating a specific solution in a specific language is but the legwork of programming.  Programmers should be spending as much time thinking about their solution than they are implementing it.

True programmers are hard to find.  But a real programmer is worth 10 coders any day of the week.
