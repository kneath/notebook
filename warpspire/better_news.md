# On building a better news site

I think everyone can agree that news companies as they exist today are unsustainable.  They are losing revenue and don't seem to have any way out.  A lot of people see it as the demise of journalism and mourn the death of a once-great industry.  I happen to see it as the biggest opportunity on the web.

## Fixing the industry has to be grounded in revenue

I believe the biggest problem with most initiatives I see around "fixing" news sites is grounded in making people read the news again.  That's an interesting tactic â€” but I don't think it's the problem. People *want* to read the news. They want to know what's happening to the world around them.  So I say base the solution on revenue. How do we create a sustainable news organization?

The basic revenue stream for most online news sites right now is advertising. Banner ads, text links, video ads, popovers, road blocks, pretty much any form of advertising they can get their hands on.  This is a broken model and will fail if they continue down that road.
