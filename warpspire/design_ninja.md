Outline:

- Worked at an agency. Our job was to redesign huge sites. Redesign everything never worked. Lots of hours in QA. Huge upfront cost, with maybe benefit.

- As designers, we want to redesign everything. Should think about small improvements. Best practices are a goal, not a baseline.

- Where to start? Add functionality with frills. Build good will.

- People use the site every day. Come to expect certain things. Use this to our advantage.

- Consistency is good, but learned behavior is better.

- Roll out updates often. Never stop. Zero downtime deploys. Deployment strategy is a design issue.

- Watch twitter, blog posts, flickr. Learn from your users. React fast. Twitter is your QA team.

- Redesign should be an experiment, not a process. You have hypothesis on what's better, your users know what's better. Don't be afraid to violate styleguide for an experiment.

# Redesign is the new something bad

Three years ago I was deep into my big agency job.  Most of the projects I worked on were redesigns of existing websites.  These sites were huge: thousands of pages of content, millions of monthly visitors.  So what did we do? We changed everything on every page.  We redesigned *everything*.  And that's just how things got done.

But looking back on how we worked, it all just feels so wrong. The process was a lot like going all-in at a poker table every hand.  These redesigns took several months of dozens of people working non-stop to finish.  The customers (people using our client's sites) didn't get any benefit until the whole thing was launched.  And even then it wasn't a guaranteed success.  What if we made mistakes in our design process? We wouldn't find out until we were done and launched and moving on to the next project.

As designers, this is our problem.  We *want* to redesign everything.  Every place we see something unpretty we want to pretty it up.  We ant to make it easier to use.  But I feel like we get lost in the end game.  We shouldn't want to redesign everything all at once. Most of the time small improvements are going to make for a better user experience. And isn't that what we should care most about?

Front end developers have the same problem. We want so often to change everything. Reformat the entire codebase to be in HTML5, our own CSS formatting, and our Javascript library of choice.  We want to enforce *best practices* everywhere. All at once.  But we need to remember that best practices should be a *goal* not a *baseline*.

## The solution

The solution is to think smaller and more customer focused.  A redesign effort should be an long running process.

But where to start?  Designers often come off as pompus. They redesign everything and defend their decisions to the core.  That's definitely a strategy, but not one I wanted to employ.  I wanted to build good will with my customers. I wanted to build trust. And I did it through design.

The most important thing we need to remember is that while people enjoy cosmetic frills, what they want is a product that is more enjoyable to use.  So for my first design push, I made sure to pick the sorest part of the UI: the repository lists.

Sure, the new version was prettier. It had gradients, clean lines, and pretty graphics.  But the most important part was that it made it easier to find the repositories you were looking for.  People were so happy with the new functionality that as a byproduct they were happy with the new cosmetics.  It's a way to build goodwill and trust in your design.  From then on, when people saw new cosmetic changes, they associated it with a feeling that things were easier to use and more functional.
